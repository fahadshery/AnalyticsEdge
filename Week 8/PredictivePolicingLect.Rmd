Predictive Policing
========================================================

In this lecture, we will discuss how visualization can offer insights in the area of policing in urban environments. The explosion of computerized data affects all parts of society, including policing. In the past, human judgment and experience was the only tool in identifying patterns in criminal behavior. Police forces around the United States and the world are augmenting human judgment with analytics.

Los Angeles police worked for months to catch Manson and his followers. These days the LAPD is on an offensive to prevent crime. Its latest weapon is a computer program that can actually predict where crimes will happen.
And justice correspondent Bob Orr has a first look at the results. In the Foothill Division north of downtown Los Angeles, police are patrolling the largely working-class neighborhoods with specially marked maps. The small red squares are hot spots, where computers project property crimes are most likely. It's called predictive policing.

A program which Captain Sean Malinowski says: puts officers on the scene before crimes occur. 65% of our crimes are burglary, grand theft auto, and burglary for motor vehicle. And that's what these boxes represent. That's a pretty small box, 500 feet by 500 feet. Yes, it is a small area. These crime prediction boxes come from the same kind of mathematical calculation used to predict earthquakes and aftershocks. By analyzing the times, dates, and places of recent crimes computers project hot spots for burglaries, break-ins, and car thefts. LA's Police Chief Charlie Beck says increasing police patrols inside those boxes denies criminals opportunity. The real measure of this is not how many people you catch, it's how much crime you prevent. I love catching people. It's what I live for. But, what I'd rather do is live in a place and work in a place where crime didn't happen.

The LAPD began testing the predictive policing model here in the Foothill Division in November, and the early results are encouraging. Burglaries are down 33%, and violent crime is also down 21%. That success will allow Beck to expand the program to other parts of the city and leverage limited resources.

The analytical tools you have learned in this class can be used to make these predictive policing models possible. However, communicating the results of these models is critical. A linear regression output table will not be of use to a police person on patrol. Visualization bridges the gap between the analytics and the end user.

we'll discuss how we can create visualizations that are used in predictive policing models. In almost every application, before we even consider a predictive model, we should try to understand the historical data. Many cities in the United States and around the world, provide logs of reported crimes, usually the time, location, and nature of the event.

We could display daily crime averages using a line graph, like the one shown here, but this doesn't seem too useful. We can see that crime tends to be higher on Saturday, but when on Saturday, and where? We could replace our x-axis with the hour of the day and have a different line for every day of the week to understand when crime occurs in more detail. But this would be a jumbled mess with seven lines, and probably very hard to read.  We could instead use no visualization at all, and instead present information in a table.

For each hour and day, we have the total number of crimes that occurred. This is a valid representation of the data, but large tables of numbers can be hard to read and understand. So how can we make the table more interesting and usable? A great way to visualize information in a two-dimensional table is with a heat map. Heat maps visualize data using three attributes. Two of the attributes are on the x and y-axes, typically displayed horizontally and verticall . The third attribute is represented by shades of color. For example, the x-axis could be hours of the day, the y-axis could be days of the week, and the colors could correspond to the amount of crime. In a heat map, we can pick different color schemes based on the type of data to convey different messages. In crime, a yellow to red color scheme might be appropriate because it can highlight some of the more dangerous areas in red. Your eye is naturally drawn to the red areas of the plot. In other applications, both high and low values are meaningful, so having a more varied color scheme might be useful. And in other applications, you might only want to see cells with high values, so you could use a gray scale to make the cells with low values white. The x and y-axes in a heat map don't need to be continuous.
In our example, we have a categorical or factor variable -- the day of the week. And we can even combine a heat map with a geographical map, which we'll discuss later in this lecture. This type of heat map is frequently used in predictive policing to show crime hot spots in a city. In this lecture, we'll use Chicago motor vehicle theft data to explore patterns of crime, both over days of the week, and over hours of the day. We're interested in analyzing the total number of car thefts that occur in any particular hour of a day of the week over our whole data set.
